## What's MusicFinder?

Have you ever met this kind of situation: Once you hear a beautiful song but don’t know the name of the song, then you cannot find it any more because you don't know the name. What a pity! However, the MusicFinder, an iOS application, can help you find this intriguing song. 

The only task you need to do is to record several seconds of the song and tab the identify button, the application will upload it to the MusicFinder Server. Just a monment, it will return the name of that song for you!

### What's our innovation?

1. We apply computer vision techniques to conduct the music feature generation and feature matching.
2. We develop a novel framewrok to perform music identification, which costs a bit more time but results in a higher accuracy.
3. We also give some insights on how to measure the music similarity.
These will be described in detail during presentation.
